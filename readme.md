# About
This repository contains all my configuration files and directories.

# Installation
A quick installation of the dotfiles can be done using [`der`](https://github.com/ThyW/der). Simply clone the repository, `cd` into it and run `der -a` to apply the dotfiles into the `~/.config/` directory. To change the output directories, take a look at the [`derfile`](./derfile) and change the stuff you want accordingly.
